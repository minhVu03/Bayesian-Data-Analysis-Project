# Introduction

Mental health has become an increasingly important topic and suicide
remains a significant public health concern worldwide, with rates
varying across regions due to complex social, economic, and cultural
factors. Therefore, understanding the geographic distribution of suicide
rates may be important for the development of targeted mental health
policies and preventative measures. Although place of habitation clearly
affect mental and physical lifestyles, there have few studies conducted
on the geographical relationship between suicide rates and mental
well-being.

In this study, we apply a Bayesian hierarchical model with a
conditionally autoregressive (CAR) prior to investigate spatial patterns
in suicide rates across countries. We model the suicide rate as a
continuous outcome using a Gaussian likelihood, with a global intercept,
a temporal effect comparing 2019 and 2021, and spatial random effects
that capture regional deviationas.

Our analysis focuses specifically on the years2019 and 2021, to
investigate any observable changes in suicide patterns potentially
influenced by global events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Inference is
performed using MCMC sampling in Stan. Our main research question is:
Are there identifiable spatial patterns that persist after taking global
and temporal effects into account, and did suicide rates change
significantly between 2019 and 2021 at a global level?

This approach allows us to identify high-risk regions, quantify
uncertainty, and better understand how suicide rates are spatially
structure, with similarities among neighboring countries. Valuable
insights from this analysis may provide the opportunity to create more
data-informed mental health interventions.

# Literature Review

In a recent press release, the CDC stated that suicide rates in the US
decreased from 2019 to 2020, but then increased from 2020 to 2021
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). Additionally,
another paper stated that factors such as domestic violence, financial
strain, and mental health conditions were prominent issues during the
pandemic, and "the social restriction practices and policies imposed by
different countries secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic might have
negatively influenced the fore-said risk factors that has been
indirectly led increased rates of suicidal attempts and deaths"
(Pathirathna et al., 2022). This information leads us to believe that it
would be worthwhile to study the difference in suicide rates in 2019 and
2021.

A similar study on the relationship between location and suicide has
been conducted, but the data was limited to regions in London and with
the rise of social media and the global pandemic, the information may
now be outdated (Congdon, P., 1997). In comparison, our dataset contains
over 150 countries and the analysis focuses on 2019 and 2021, which may
show the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates.

# Dataset and Data Cleaning

Dataset Name: Crude Suicide Rate (Per 100,000 Population)

Source:
<https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates>

Description: The raw dataset has notable features like country, age
group, sex, and suicide rate (per 100,000 people) that can be extracted.

Location: Country name

Period: Year (2019, 2021)

Dim1: Sex ("Female", "Both sexes", "Male)

FactValueNumeric: Number of suicide deaths in a year, divided by the
population and multiplied by 100 000 (as indicated in the original data
source)

FactValueNumericLow: Low estimate

FactValueNumericHigh: High estimate

Note: The FactValueNumeric data are estimates of the number of suicides.
The data was obtained from the WHO Global Health Estimates (GHE), but
some countries may not have an accurate way of recording the exact
number of deaths, potentially leading to inaccurate estimations. Hence
there is a high and low in the death rates. The source states, "for
countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death
estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys
with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special
studies" (World Health Organization, n.d.).

We filter out observations where sex is “Both Sexes” to remove
duplicates, as this level accounts for observations that are already
labeled either as “Female” or “Male.” See (A2) for the R code. The first
six rows of the dataset are shown below:

```{r}
data_raw = read.csv("suicide_rate_raw.csv", header = TRUE)

#filter out "both sexes" to avoid duplication
data = as.data.frame(data_raw |> select(Location, Period, Dim1, FactValueNumeric, FactValueNumericLow, FactValueNumericHigh) |> filter(Dim1 %in% c("Female", "Male")) |> filter(Period %in% c(2019,2021)))
unique(data$Period)

max(data$FactValueNumeric)
min(data$FactValueNumeric)

nrow(data)
head(data)
```

The dataset after filtering consists of 740 observations.

<!-- filter data to only include 2019 and 2021 -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- suicide_2019 <- filter(data, Period == 2019) -->

<!-- suicide_2021 <- filter(data, Period == 2021) -->

<!-- ``` -->

# Data Analysis

As we have obtained the cleaned data for suicide rates in 2019 and 2021,
we can now declare a prior model from information obtained from previous
studies.

## **Model**

Priors:

$\mu \sim \mathcal{N}(9.2, 3)$

$\beta \sim \mathcal{N}(0.1, 0.05)$

$\sigma_\phi \sim \text{Exp}(1)$

$\sigma \sim \text{Exp}(1)$

$\phi_{\text{node1}[i]} - \phi_{\text{node2}[i]} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma_\phi^2\right) \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, N_{\text{edges}}$

$\sum_{r=1}^R \phi_r^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, R \cdot \sigma_\phi^2\right)$

Likelihood:

$y_n \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu + \beta \cdot t_n + \phi_{r_n}, \sigma) \quad \text{for } n = 1, \ldots, N$

In 2020, the global average suicide rate was 9.2 people per 100,000
people (World Health Organization, n.d.). Therefore, we've chosen this
as the mean for our prior on the estimate of the global suicide rate
$\mu$. Additionally, a standard deviation of 3 allows for reasonable
uncertainty around the average without being overly tight.

The $\beta$ parameter represents the effect of time. In the US, the
suicide rate in 2019 was 13.9 people per 100,000, then decreased to
13.5 people per 100,000 in 2020. It increased to 14 people per 100,000
in 2021, so we've used the overall change in suicide rate, 0.1, from
2019 to 2021 as the mean parameter.

The prior on both the standard deviation of spatial effects
$\sigma_\phi$ and the observation noise $\sigma$ is $Exp(1)$, which
allows for smaller, more reasonable standard deviations. We've chosen to
use weakly informative parameters here.

## Get Adjacency Pairs

Our dataset does not include information on the neighbors of each
country, so we’ve used an additional dataset rnaturalearthdata to inform
the conditional autoregressive aspect of the model. We renamed the
country names in our dataset to match that of rnaturalearthdata’s. See
(A3) for the R code. Then, we can join the two datasets so our original
dataset will have adjacency parameters from the world_sf dataset. We
also convert the country-level spatial polygons into adjacency pairs to
represent neighboring countries, which we will use to build the CAR
prior structure in our model.

```{r}
data_cleaned <- data %>%
  mutate(Location = case_when(
    Location == "Viet Nam" ~ "Vietnam",
    Location == "Türkiye" ~ "Turkey",
    Location == "Iran (Islamic Republic of)" ~ "Iran",
    Location == "Russian Federation" ~ "Russia",
    Location == "Republic of Korea" ~ "South Korea",
    Location == "Syrian Arab Republic" ~ "Syria",
    Location == "Brunei Darussalam" ~ "Brunei",
    Location == "Netherlands (Kingdom of the)" ~ "Netherlands",
    Location == "Republic of Moldova" ~ "Moldova",
    Location == "Lao People's Democratic Republic" ~ "Laos",
    Location == "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" ~ "United Kingdom",
    Location == "Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)" ~ "Venezuela",
    Location == "Bolivia (Plurinational State of)" ~ "Bolivia",
    Location == "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" ~ "North Korea",
    Location == "Micronesia (Federated States of)" ~ "Federated States of Micronesia",
    Location == "Cote d'Ivoire" ~ "Ivory Coast",
    Location == "Eswatini" ~ "eSwatini",
    Location == "Timor-Leste" ~ "East Timor",
    Location == "occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem" ~ "Palestine",
    Location == "Sao Tome and Principe" ~ "São Tomé and Principe",
    Location == "Bahamas" ~ "The Bahamas",
    Location == "Congo" ~ "Republic of the Congo",
    Location == "Serbia" ~ "Republic of Serbia",
    TRUE ~ Location  # keep all other names unchanged
  ))
```

Now we can join the two datasets so our original dataset will have
adjacency parameters from world_sf

```{r}
# From rnaturalearth dataset
world_sf <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf") %>%
  st_make_valid() %>%
  filter(admin %in% data_cleaned$Location) %>%
  arrange(admin)  # ensure a consistent order

world_sf$region_id <- 1:nrow(world_sf)

data_matched <- data_cleaned %>%
  filter(Location %in% world_sf$admin) %>%
  left_join(world_sf %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% select(admin, region_id),
            by = c("Location" = "admin"))

stopifnot(all(!is.na(data_matched$region_id)))

any(world_sf$region_id == 0)
```

## Convert Neighbor List to Adjacency Pairs

```{r}
world_sp <- as(world_sf, "Spatial")

neighbors <- poly2nb(world_sp, row.names = world_sf$region_id)

num_neighbors <- sapply(neighbors, length)
R <- length(neighbors)

#regions with at least one neighbor -> we want to leave out countries with no neighbors
valid_indices <- which(num_neighbors > 0)

node1 <- c()
node2 <- c()

for (i in valid_indices) { #only make nodes for countries with neighbors
  for (j in neighbors[[i]]) {
    if (j != 0 && world_sf$region_id[j] != 0) { #purposefully excluded zeros so node2 doesnt 
                                               # have 0 "indexing" from region_id in world_sf
      node1 <- c(node1, world_sf$region_id[i])
      node2 <- c(node2, world_sf$region_id[j])
    }
  }
}

stopifnot(!any(node2 == 0))
length(node1)
length(node2)
any(node2==0)
```

## STAN Data List

Now we can build our list of data inputs formatted for our Stan model.
See (A11) for the Stan file and A(6) for the R code.

Note: We’ve chosen to use iter=4000 and warmup=2000 to improve MCMC
mixing. Initially, we attempted using iter=2000 and found that the
chains did not mix well for mu, and increasing the number of iterations
provided a slight improvement.

```{r}
nrow(data_matched)
stan_data <- list(
  N = nrow(data_matched),
  y = data_matched$FactValueNumeric,
  time = as.integer(data_matched$Period == 2021),
  R = R,
  region = data_matched$region_id,
  N_edges = length(node1),
  node1 = node1,
  node2 = node2,
  num_neighbors = num_neighbors
)

```

Now, we can estimate the posterior. Code reference:
<https://ubc-stat-ml.github.io/web447/w08_mcmc1/topic06_hands_on.html>
Why use iter = 2000 and chains = 4:

```{r}
model <- stan_model(file = "model.stan")
fit <- sampling(model, data = stan_data, iter = 4000, warmup = 2000, chains = 4, seed = 123)
print(fit)
```

We see that the temporal effect beta has a mean of 0.10, which suggests
a slight increase in suicide rates in 2021 compared to 2019. However,
zero is barely included in the 95% credible interval, which suggests
that there is weak evidence of a time effect. Therefore, we conclude
that there may be a small increased in suicide rates from 2019 to 2021,
but the evidence is weak.

The phi[r] values represent the country-level deviations from the global
suicide rate after adjusting for time. These come from a CAR prior, so
they reflect spatial smoothing. We see that many of the values are
non-zero (e.g. phi[5] = -8.50, indicating that this country has a
suicide rate that is much lower than expected). This supports our
assumption that spatial effects are strong and certain regions differ
notably from the global mean, even after controlling for year.
Additionally, some of the 95% credible intervals exclude 0, which
provides strong evidence of spatial variation. See A(8) for a longer
output of the estimates.

Our current model also requires that we estimate a parameter for every
country, which has led to a very complex model. In further studies, it
would be helpful to use Rao Blackwellization or similar methods to
reduce the complexity of the model.

# Model Diagnostics

Now we can assess how well MCMC is mixing by using trace plots.

```{r, fig.height=3}
head(summary(fit)$summary)
mcmc_trace(as.array(fit), pars = c("mu", "sigma", "sigma_phi"))

```

We observe that the trace plots for sigma and sigma_phi seem to be
mixing well and converging. This indicates that is reliably estimated
and the CAR prior is sampling effectively. However, we note that the
trace plot for shows that the chains do not overlap well and may not
converge. We’ve run the program multiple times to rule out “bad luck” as
the cause and increased the number of iterations from 2000 to 4000,
which helped minimally. The next steps would be to try a different
proposal distribution, a different MCMC algorithm, or simplify the
model.

## Posterior Visualization

Now we can use the mapview library to visualize the posterior mean of
the spatial effects on a map.

```{r}
# posterior samples for phi
phi_samples <- rstan::extract(fit)$phi

# posterior mean of phi for each region
phi_mean <- apply(phi_samples, 2, mean)

world_sf$phi_mean <- phi_mean

m <- mapview(world_sf, zcol = "phi_mean")
m

# uncomment the following lines to convert to png
#mapshot(m, file = "phi_map.png")
#knitr::include_graphics("phi_map.png")
```

This visualization tells us how much each country deviates from the
global average suicide rate, after adjusting for time. Countries that
are darker in color indicate a lower-than-expected suicide rate, while
countries that are lighter in color indicate a higher-than-expected
suicide rate. 

\
We see that cluster of high and low phi_mean are clearly visible (e.g.
Eastern Europe countries are lighter in color and Sub-Saharan Africa
countries are darker in color). Since the colorings are not random, they
form geographically contiguous regions and strongly suggest spatial
structure.

# **Discussion**

## **Results**

This analysis provides strong evidence that there is a spatial pattern
in suicide rates. Our model identified strong regional deviations in
suicide rates, even after adjusting for time, and many countries shower
posterior mean spatial effects that were significantly above or below
the global average. Since these deviations form geographic clusters
rather than being randomly distributed, the analysis suggests that
suicide rates are spatially dependent.

The time effect parameter had a posterior mean of 0.1 and a 95% credible
interval that barely excluded zero. This suggests that there may be a
slight increase in suicide rates from 2019 to 2021, which could be
linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the magnitude is small and not
strongly supported by the posterior.

Based on these results, it may be beneficial to focus on employing more
mental health resources in countries like Russia and South Africa, where
the suicide rates are higher than expected. Looking further into
countries with suicide rates that are lower than expected may also be
helpful, as they may offer protective factors worth studying (e.g.
cultural or social influences).

## **Limitations**

The spatial prior assumes that nearby countries have similar suicide
rates, so if there are sharp differences between neighboring regions,
the model may over-smooth and underrepresent the true variation.
Additionally, the focus of this analysis is whether or not there is a
spatial relationship between location and suicide rate, but it does not
consider underlying factors, such as culture, mental health resources,
and economic state. For example, the topic of mental health is
considered to be taboo in many countries, resulting in limited access to
mental health resources.

A next step would be to incorporate Rao Blackwellization or another form
of model reduction to reduce the number of parameters and provide easier
interpretability. It may also be helpful to look further into these
underlying factors and determine whether or not there is a relationship
between the factor and suicide rate (e.g. is there a relationship
between suicide rate and lower income households in the United States
and Canada?). This can be combined with information about distribution
of suicide rates across sex and age to give more insight into which
subset of groups should be targeted for suicide prevention methods in
certain countries.
