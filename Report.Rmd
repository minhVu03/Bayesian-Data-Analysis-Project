# Introduction
In our world today, mental health has become more crucial and suicide remains a significant public health concern worldwide, with rates varying across regions due to complex social, economic, and cultural factors. Therefore, understanding the geographic distribution of suicide rates is important for the development of targeted mental health policies and preventative measures. Although where we live in the world largely affects our mental and physical lifestyles, there has not been many studies done on the geographical characteristics of suicide rates and mental well-being.

In this study, we apply a Bayesian hierarchical model with a conditionally autoregressive (CAR) prior to investigate spatial patterns in suicide rates across countries, stratified by sex groups. We will be using a Poisson likelihood to obtain a prior distribution. After which, inferential analysis will be done using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) done in Stan.

This research specifically focuses on two recent years,2019 and 2021, to investigate any observable changes in suicide patterns potentially influenced by global events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Our main research question is: Are there identifiable spatial clusters of high suicide rates, and do these rates differ between 2019 and 2021?

This approach allows us to identify high-risk regions, quantify uncertainty, and better understand how neighboring countries may influence each other’s suicide rates, providing valuable insights for data-informed mental health interventions.


# Literature Review
## TO DO

# Dataset and Data Cleaning
Dataset Name: Crude Suicide Rate (Per 100,000 Population)
Source: https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates
Description: The raw dataset has notable features like country, age group, sex, and suicide rate (per 100,000 people) that can be extracted.

Location: Country name
Period: Year (2019, 2021)
Dim1: Sex ("Female", "Both sexes", "Male)
FactValueNumeric: Number of suicide deaths in a year, divided by the population and multiplied by 100 000 (as indicated in the original data source)
FactValueNumericLow: Low estimate
FactValueNumericHigh: High estimate

Note: The FactValueNumeric data are estimates of the number of suicides. "The estimates are derived from the WHO Global Health Estimates (GHE)" [data source]. However, some countries may not have an accurate way of recording the exact number of deaths, potentially leading to inaccurate estimations. Hence there is a high and low in the death rates.
"For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies" [data source].

```{r}
data_raw = read.csv("suicide_rate_raw.csv", header = TRUE)
#filter out "both sexes" to avoid duplication
data = as.data.frame(data_raw |> select(Location, Period, Dim1, FactValueNumeric, FactValueNumericLow, FactValueNumericHigh) |> filter(Dim1 %in% c("Female", "Male")) |> filter(Period %in% c(2019,2021)))
unique(data$Period)
# unique(data$Location)
max(data$FactValueNumeric)
min(data$FactValueNumeric)

nrow(data)

```
The dataset after filtering consists of 740 observations.

<!-- filter data to only include 2019 and 2021 -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- suicide_2019 <- filter(data, Period == 2019) -->
<!-- suicide_2021 <- filter(data, Period == 2021) -->
<!-- ``` -->


# Data Analysis
As we have obtained the cleaned data for suicide rates in 2019 and 2021, we can now declare a prior model from information obtained historically.

## Explanation of priors
... Numbers in the parameters list in stan code

## Get adjacency pairs
Firstly we need to know which countries are neighbours of each other
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnaturalearth/vignettes/rnaturalearth.html

During the data analysis process we realized that the country names in our dataset did not match with the country names of the rnaturalearthdata dataset that we are using to model the spatial data. This led to the model mistaking the countries as having no neighbours and producing nodes with values 0.
To solve this, we renamed the country names in our dataset to match that of rnaturalworld's

```{r}
# unique(data$Location)
# unique(world_sf$admin)

data_cleaned <- data %>%
  mutate(Location = case_when(
    Location == "Viet Nam" ~ "Vietnam",
    Location == "Türkiye" ~ "Turkey",
    Location == "Iran (Islamic Republic of)" ~ "Iran",
    Location == "Russian Federation" ~ "Russia",
    Location == "Republic of Korea" ~ "South Korea",
    Location == "Syrian Arab Republic" ~ "Syria",
    Location == "Brunei Darussalam" ~ "Brunei",
    Location == "Netherlands (Kingdom of the)" ~ "Netherlands",
    Location == "Republic of Moldova" ~ "Moldova",
    Location == "Lao People's Democratic Republic" ~ "Laos",
    Location == "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" ~ "United Kingdom",
    Location == "Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)" ~ "Venezuela",
    Location == "Bolivia (Plurinational State of)" ~ "Bolivia",
    Location == "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" ~ "North Korea",
    Location == "Micronesia (Federated States of)" ~ "Federated States of Micronesia",
    Location == "Cote d'Ivoire" ~ "Ivory Coast",
    Location == "Eswatini" ~ "eSwatini",
    Location == "Timor-Leste" ~ "East Timor",
    Location == "occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem" ~ "Palestine",
    Location == "Sao Tome and Principe" ~ "São Tomé and Principe",
    Location == "Bahamas" ~ "The Bahamas",
    Location == "Congo" ~ "Republic of the Congo",
    Location == "Serbia" ~ "Republic of Serbia",
    TRUE ~ Location  # keep all other names unchanged
  ))
#Search for country names in both datasets for debugging and filtering names
#subset(data_cleaned, grepl("Singapore", Location, ignore.case = TRUE))
# unique(subset(world_sf, grepl("Singapore", admin, ignore.case = TRUE)))

```

Now we can join the two datasets so our original dataset will have adjacency parameters from world_sf
```{r}
#From rnaturalearth dataset
world_sf <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf") %>%
  st_make_valid() %>%
  filter(admin %in% data_cleaned$Location) %>%
  arrange(admin)  # ensure a consistent order

world_sf$region_id <- 1:nrow(world_sf)

data_matched <- data_cleaned %>%
  filter(Location %in% world_sf$admin) %>%
  left_join(world_sf %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% select(admin, region_id),
            by = c("Location" = "admin"))

stopifnot(all(!is.na(data_matched$region_id)))

any(world_sf$region_id == 0)


```

## Convert Neighbor List to Adjacency Pairs
```{r}
world_sp <- as(world_sf, "Spatial")

#### making neighbors!!
neighbors <- poly2nb(world_sp, row.names = world_sf$region_id)

num_neighbors <- sapply(neighbors, length)
R <- length(neighbors)

#regions with at least one neighbor -> we want to leave out countries with no neighbors
valid_indices <- which(num_neighbors > 0)

node1 <- c()
node2 <- c()

for (i in valid_indices) { #only make nodes for countries with neighbors
  for (j in neighbors[[i]]) {
    if (j != 0 && world_sf$region_id[j] != 0) { #i purposely excluded zeros so node2 doesnt have 0 "indexing" from region_id in world_sf
      node1 <- c(node1, world_sf$region_id[i])
      node2 <- c(node2, world_sf$region_id[j])
    }
  }
}

stopifnot(!any(node2 == 0))
length(node1)
length(node2)
any(node2==0) #a lot of debugging led to this being false


```

## STAN Data List
```{r}
nrow(data_matched)
stan_data <- list(
  N = nrow(data_matched),
  y = data_matched$FactValueNumeric,
  time = as.integer(data_matched$Period == 2021),
  R = R,
  region = data_matched$region_id,
  N_edges = length(node1),
  node1 = node1,
  node2 = node2,
  num_neighbors = num_neighbors
)

```


Extract posterior data from STAN code file
Code reference: https://ubc-stat-ml.github.io/web447/w08_mcmc1/topic06_hands_on.html
Why use iter = 2000 and chains = 4:
```{r}
#setwd("C:/Users/Minh/OneDrive/Documents/Bayesian-Data-Analysis-Project")
model <- stan_model(file = "model.stan")
fit <- sampling(model, data = stan_data, iter = 2000, chains = 4, seed = 123)
print(fit)
```
